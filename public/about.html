<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Hi, I’m John Cristopher, a Web Developer (soon to be) with a renewed passion for learning and trying out new things and I love riding a bicycle everyday.</p>
<h2>My Journey</h2>
  <p>I’ve worked in Software Quality Assurance for 12 years (a bit old now but still very hungry and eager to be the best developer in town) 
    and have experience in Manual Testing and less than a year for Automated Testing. 
  </p>
<h2>What I do</h2>
  <p>
    I help Software teams achieve Bug free (impossible) Applications by finding as many bugs and defects as possible.
  </p>
<h2>A little More About Me</h2>
  <p>
    When I’m not testing software applications, you can find me riding a bike around the town. 
    Also, I love doing DIY repairs on things that captures my eyes.
  </p>
<h2>Let's Connect</h2>
  <p>
    Feel free to reach out if you want some repairs on anything (it's free anyway). You can find me on Facebook and LinkedIn or through my Contact Page.
